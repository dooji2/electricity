**Electricity** is a Minecraft mod that adds utility poles, wind turbines, power boxes and other things.

As of now the mod is still under active development as it is not finished. There will be support for many other Minecraft versions and/or modloaders in the future!

For now, you can use it with Electric Lamps. A power box creates an area around it, in which it distributes the power to blocks that implement the Electricity API (for example, a mod that adds a lamp could change their light level based on how much power it gets, or break if it gets too much).

No survival recipes for now. For usage and other important information, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/dooji2/electricity/wiki).
